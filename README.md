# IDG-DP

<ins>**Differentially Private Integrated Decision Gradients (IDG-DP) for Radar-based
Human Activity Recognition**</ins>

This project aims to develop a differentially private human activity recognition method tailored for the proficient detection of membership attacks, particularly in RADAR settings. The associated GitHub repository comprises pre-trained models and scripts to ensure reproducibility. Adversarial Robustness Toolbox was utilized for generating attacks the testing membership inference attacks.
